# Probability

This course is a comprehensive dive into the fundamental concepts and principles of probability. You’ll begin with basic probability theory, then progress to more complex topics such as binomial distributions, conditional probability, and Bayes’ Rule. These skills will enhance your ability to reason about uncertainty and make claims using data.

## Introduction

**Probability:** Make predictions about future events based on models or causes that we assume

**Statistics**: Analyze the data from past events to infer what the models or causes could be

### In this lesson, we will cover and you will be able to:

- Describe and calculate the probability of one event given another
- Calculate the opposite of an event
- Calculate the probability of a composite event
